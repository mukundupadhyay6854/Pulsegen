Swiggy,2023-07-24 09:57:40,I have been using swiggy for a long time and It worked fine untill i encountered this error where they show you an offer to buy swiggy one but the app doesn't work when you actually try to proceed to buy swiggy one membership. And to think such a big company would let such a bug persist in their consumer app without resolution after it was reported is just senseless for a software developer like me. For that reason alone I am eating it 2 stars,2,103,"Hey there, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.

Swiggy,2023-07-23 10:35:23,"Worst experiences I'm having with the app for last couple of months...but today's was worst. Such a irresponsible delivery partner,app is worst and the customer support was horrible. I don't even prefer giving 1 rating but wanted to put my feedback and app asked for feedback...

Swiggy,2023-07-24 14:48:26,The best foolishing app with offers. The app offered like one item free when you order over 199. But delivered without the item.

Swiggy,2023-07-07 08:26:00,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Swiggy Instamart I had a disappointing experience with Swiggy Instamart recently. I ordered a few items, but two of them were missing from the delivery. These missing items cost me 400 rupees.

Their lack of responsiveness and unwillingness to address the issue left me frustrated and dissatisfied. I provided evidence of the missing",1,85,"Hey there, we are sorry to have put you through such a situation.

Swiggy,2023-07-19 07:40:05,"Worst ever experience. I ordered from instamart and got only few items. On complaining, swiggy told me that they will share feedback with vendor management team instead of giving me the refund (they charged me for delivery already). Happened more that twice. Uninstalling app and never using again. The support is automated with no human intervention and no action taken even after multiple emails. Totally harrowing experiences lately.

Swiggy,2023-07-23 19:50:01,I got expired items in instamart and support says that they will just forward feedback to vendor. Instead of either replacement or refund. They even moved their support from in app to emails which is basically a bot sending automated emails. Even after multiple emails I was given no replacement or refund. I would not recommend using swiggy.,1,8,This shouldn't have happened.

Swiggy,2023-07-16 22:40:33,"Overpriced. When i order multiple items, the restaurant miss to pack one or two items. When i complaint it, swiggy will just return my amount.

Swiggy,2023-07-17 14:46:08,Worst Fraud app. They want us yo cancel the order with in one minute. But there's no cancellation option. Rather you can cancel the order by chatting with the bot. That's not the whole story. The chat bot ask you 4 times to confirm of you want to cancel the order and that's how they will deduct the entire money because you can't cancel the order within one minute. And the customer support asked to send an email bacause they can't do anything from there end.,1,46,"Hello, we're sorry for the unpleasant experience.

Since a few weeks whenever there is a defect in the order delivered or some items are missing, after contacting chat, they ask to send an email and on email they say they can't do anything, even when order items are missing.

Swiggy,2023-07-14 18:39:06,Instarmart experience was pathetic. I didn't even receive an order 1 hour after ordering and later they cancelled the order without informing me. I was told that due to operational constraints the order can't be delivered. The support agent didn't bother to address the issue. Just wasted 1.5 hrs of time. Better to use other apps who are much much better at providing service or a proper resolution for any issue.,1,23,"We're apologetic about this experience you've faced while ordering with us.

Swiggy,2023-07-17 18:49:46,Worst support team. They always want to composate with misplaced or wrong order. In words they say that they prioritize the issue but they won't. The location tracking is worst address what we selected will be different always. Don't use this app and don't waste your precious money and time.

Swiggy,2023-07-19 07:47:42,BAD SERVICE! Most of the deliveries are late than the time given or even canceled. Better switch to other delivery apps. Very bad experiences not just once but many times they will just resolve by refunding but what about time wasted and waiting for the food. DON'T EVER DOWNLOAD even for instamart or other services.

These days swiggy is not at all concerned about customer who is ordering from their app. I have missing items reported with photos and they haven't taken any action/issued any refund ....I am one who paid for the missing item.

Better order directly from the restaurant, atleast you can cal them and complain about the quality issue.

Can u imagine the kind of frustration one faces to hear this. This has happened to me several times. They only assure to take strict action against the restaurant which may not even happen.

Swiggy,2023-07-08 15:58:41,"1. Delivery time is misleading. On the home page, delivery time is shown less but during actual payout, delivery time increases(sometimes doubles). Then after order confirmation, it doesn't even show the delivery time because the delivery is done by the restaurant and now there is no way to track it. 2. GST and restaurant charges much higher than Zomato 3. Food price is also higher than Zomato by margin of 10-15 rupees.",2,2,,,4.35.4
